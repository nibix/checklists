# checklists
Dedicated check list and check table data structures for Java.

Check lists and check tables take a set of items as input; initially, all items will be marked as unchecked.
You can then use the various methods to mark individual items as checked. Further methods allow you to check
whether your check list or check table is complete - and when not, what is missing.

A check list is a one-dimensional list, a check table is a two-dimensional matrix.
